Coursera course (Getting and cleaning data) project:
----------------------------------------------------

There is only one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

**Data source background**

The data source used for this project are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

**Data location**

After the above data zip file is downloaded, it should be extracted and folder within should be placed inside the working directory of the R environment running the run_analysis.R scripts.

The tidy data file will be generated to the same working directory too.
